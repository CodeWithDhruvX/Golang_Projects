Since you’ve asked for the architecture diagram to be included in the Markdown content without using Mermaid, I’ll create a text-based ASCII diagram to represent the Employee Onboarding System’s architecture. I’ll also ensure the diagram is embedded in the Markdown file and provide a clear explanation of the **file flow**, **design patterns**, and **how they work**, as requested. The ASCII diagram will visually depict the services, their interactions, and data flow in a simple, renderable format suitable for Markdown.

Below is the complete Markdown content with the ASCII diagram, followed by the file flow and design pattern explanations.

## Employee Onboarding System Architecture

### Architecture Diagram

Below is a text-based ASCII diagram illustrating the architecture of the Employee Onboarding System. It shows the **HR Service** as the orchestrator, interacting with the **IT Setup**, **Email Provisioner**, and **Access Rights** services via HTTP, with each service connected to its own MySQL database. The shared `common` package provides reusable components.

**Diagram Explanation**:
- **Client (HR Admin)**: Sends onboarding requests to the HR Service.
- **HR Service**: Orchestrates the process, saves employee data, and calls other services via HTTP.
- **IT Setup Service**: Provisions devices (e.g., laptops) and stores records in `it_provisions`.
- **Email Provisioner Service**: Simulates email account setup and logs in `email_logs`.
- **Access Rights Service**: Grants permissions and stores them in `access_grants`.
- **Shared Components**: Provide the `Employee` model and HTTP client used across services.
- **MySQL Databases**: Each service has its own database table for persistence.

---

## File Flow Explanation

The **file flow** describes how data moves through the system when an HR admin triggers an onboarding request (e.g., POST `/api/v1/onboard` with `{"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com", "address": "123 Main St", "role": "Dev"}`). I’ll trace the flow from the client request to the database updates across all services, highlighting file interactions.

### **Step-by-Step File Flow**

1. **Client Request to HR Service**
   - **File**: `hr-service/cmd/server/main.go`
     - **Role**: Entry point for the HR Service. Initializes the Gin router, MySQL connection, and dependencies (repository, HTTP clients). Routes the `/onboard` request to `delivery/http/handler.go`.
     - **Flow**: The client’s HTTP POST request hits the Gin server (port 8080).
     - **Connections**: Sets up `EmployeeHandler`, `EmployeeUsecase`, `EmployeeRepository`, and HTTP clients (from `common/httpclient/client.go`).

2. **Handling the HTTP Request**
   - **File**: `hr-service/delivery/http/handler.go`
     - **Role**: The `Onboard` method binds the JSON request to `domain.OnboardingRequest` (defined in `hr-service/domain/employee.go`, using `common/models/employee.go`).
     - **Flow**: Validates the JSON, then calls `usecase.EmployeeUsecase.Onboard`.
     - **Connections**: Depends on `domain/employee.go` (for `OnboardingRequest`) and `usecase/employee_usecase.go`.

3. **Business Logic & Orchestration**
   - **File**: `hr-service/usecase/employee_usecase.go`
     - **Role**: Implements the `Onboard` method, which:
       1. Saves the employee to the database via `repository.EmployeeRepository.Save`.
       2. Orchestrates calls to IT, Email, and Access Rights services using `infrastructure/http/orchestrator.go`.
     - **Flow**:
       - Calls `infrastructure/repository/mysql_repository.go` to save the employee to the `employees` table.
       - Uses `common/httpclient/client.go` to send HTTP POST requests to:
         - IT Service: `/api/v1/provision` (payload: `{"employee_id": <id>}`).
         - Email Service: `/api/v1/send` (payload: `{"employee_id": <id>, "email": "<email>"}`).
         - Access Rights Service: `/api/v1/grant` (payload: `{"employee_id": <id>}`).
     - **Connections**: Depends on `repository/interface.go`, `infrastructure/http/orchestrator.go`, and `common/httpclient/client.go`.

4. **HR Service Database Storage**
   - **File**: `hr-service/infrastructure/repository/mysql_repository.go`
     - **Role**: Executes an SQL `INSERT` to save employee data (`name`, `email`, `address`, `role`) in the `employees` table and returns the generated `ID`.
     - **Flow**: Returns the saved `Employee` to `usecase/employee_usecase.go`.
     - **Connections**: Implements `repository/interface.go`.

5. **IT Setup Service Processing**
   - **Files**:
     - `it-setup-service/cmd/server/main.go`: Receives the `/provision` request (port 8081) and routes it to `delivery/http/handler.go`.
     - `it-setup-service/delivery/http/handler.go`: Binds the JSON request to `domain.ProvisionRequest` (from `domain/provision.go`) and calls `usecase.ProvisionUsecase.Provision`.
     - `it-setup-service/usecase/provision_usecase.go`: Creates a `Provision` struct (hardcoding `Device: "Laptop"`, `Status: "Provisioned"`) and calls `repository.ProvisionRepository.Save`.
     - `it-setup-service/infrastructure/repository/mysql_repository.go`: Inserts the provision data into the `it_provisions` table.
   - **Flow**: The HR Service’s HTTP call triggers the IT Service to log a device provisioning record.
   - **Connections**: Uses `domain/provision.go` and `repository/interface.go`.

6. **Email Provisioner Service Processing**
   - **Files**:
     - `email-provisioner-service/cmd/server/main.go`: Receives the `/send` request (port 8082) and routes it to `delivery/http/handler.go`.
     - `email-provisioner-service/delivery/http/handler.go`: Binds the JSON request to `domain.SendRequest` (from `domain/email.go`) and calls `usecase.EmailUsecase.Send`.
     - `email-provisioner-service/usecase/email_usecase.go`: Calls `infrastructure/email/mock_sender.go` to simulate sending an email, then saves a log via `repository.EmailRepository.Save`.
     - `email-provisioner-service/infrastructure/repository/mysql_repository.go`: Inserts the email log into the `email_logs` table.
   - **Flow**: The HR Service’s HTTP call triggers the Email Service to simulate an email setup and log it.
   - **Connections**: Uses `domain/email.go`, `infrastructure/email/interface.go`, and `repository/interface.go`.

7. **Access Rights Service Processing**
   - **Files**:
     - `access-rights-service/cmd/server/main.go`: Receives the `/grant` request (port 8083) and routes it to `delivery/http/handler.go`.
     - `access-rights-service/delivery/http/handler.go`: Binds the JSON request to `domain.GrantRequest` (from `domain/access.go`) and calls `usecase.AccessUsecase.Grant`.
     - `access-rights-service/usecase/access_usecase.go`: Creates an `AccessGrant` struct (hardcoding `Permissions: ["read", "write"]`) and calls `repository.AccessRepository.Save`.
     - `access-rights-service/infrastructure/repository/mysql_repository.go`: Inserts the access grant into the `access_grants` table (permissions as JSON).
   - **Flow**: The HR Service’s HTTP call triggers the Access Rights Service to grant and log permissions.
   - **Connections**: Uses `domain/access.go` and `repository/interface.go`.

8. **Response to Client**
   - **File**: `hr-service/delivery/http/handler.go`
     - **Role**: Returns the saved `Employee` as a JSON response (HTTP 201 Created) to the client.
     - **Flow**: The onboarding process completes, and the HR admin receives confirmation.

### **Summary of File Flow**
- **Client → HR Service**: Request hits `main.go` → `handler.go` → `usecase.go` → `repository.go` to save the employee.
- **HR Service → External Services**: `usecase.go` → `orchestrator.go` → `httpclient.go` sends HTTP requests to IT, Email, and Access Rights services.
- **External Services**: Each service follows the same flow: `main.go` → `handler.go` → `usecase.go` → `repository.go` to process and save data.
- **Response**: HR Service returns the employee data to the client.

## Design Patterns Used

The system leverages several design patterns to ensure modularity, testability, and scalability. Here’s a detailed look at each pattern and how it functions in the project:

1. **Clean Architecture**
   - **What**: Organizes the codebase into layers: **Domain** (data models), **Usecase** (business logic), **Repository** (data access), and **Delivery** (HTTP handling).
   - **How It Works**:
     - **Domain**: Defines structs like `Employee` (`common/models/employee.go`), `Provision` (`it-setup-service/domain/provision.go`), `EmailLog` (`email-provisioner-service/domain/email.go`), and `AccessGrant` (`access-rights-service/domain/access.go`).
     - **Usecase**: Encapsulates business logic, e.g., `hr-service/usecase/employee_usecase.go` handles onboarding orchestration, `it-setup-service/usecase/provision_usecase.go` provisions devices.
     - **Repository**: Abstracts database operations, e.g., `hr-service/infrastructure/repository/mysql_repository.go` saves employees, `it-setup-service/infrastructure/repository/mysql_repository.go` saves provisions.
     - **Delivery**: Manages HTTP requests, e.g., `hr-service/delivery/http/handler.go` processes `/onboard` requests.
     - Each layer depends only on lower layers (e.g., usecase depends on repository, not vice versa), ensuring loose coupling.
   - **Why**: Isolates business logic from external systems (e.g., databases, HTTP clients), making the code testable and adaptable (e.g., swap MySQL for PostgreSQL).

2. **Repository Pattern**
   - **What**: Abstracts data access using interfaces (e.g., `hr-service/repository/interface.go`, `it-setup-service/repository/interface.go`).
   - **How It Works**:
     - Interfaces like `EmployeeRepository`, `ProvisionRepository`, `EmailRepository`, and `AccessRepository` define methods (e.g., `Save`, `FindByID`).
     - Concrete implementations (e.g., `mysql_repository.go` in each service) handle MySQL queries.
     - Usecases depend on the interface, enabling mock implementations for testing (e.g., `hr-service/hr_test.go`).
   - **Why**: Decouples business logic from database specifics, allowing easy testing and database changes.

3. **Orchestrator Pattern**
   - **What**: The HR Service coordinates multiple services via HTTP calls in `hr-service/infrastructure/http/orchestrator.go`.
   - **How It Works**:
     - `employeeUsecase.Onboard` calls `CallITProvision`, `CallEmailSend`, and `CallAccessGrant` to trigger actions in IT, Email, and Access Rights services.
     - Uses `common/httpclient/client.go` to send HTTP POST requests.
   - **Why**: Centralizes coordination, simplifying the management of inter-service dependencies.

4. **Dependency Injection**
   - **What**: Passes dependencies (e.g., repositories, HTTP clients) to components instead of hardcoding them.
   - **How It Works**:
     - In `hr-service/cmd/server/main.go`, `EmployeeUsecase` is initialized with `EmployeeRepository` and HTTP clients.
     - Similarly, each service’s `main.go` injects repositories and other dependencies into usecases and handlers.
   - **Why**: Enhances testability (mocks can be injected) and flexibility (dependencies can be swapped).

5. **Adapter Pattern**
   - **What**: The `common/httpclient/client.go` abstracts HTTP communication.
   - **How It Works**:
     - Provides a `Client` struct with a `Post` method for sending JSON requests.
     - Used by `hr-service/infrastructure/http/orchestrator.go` to call external services.
   - **Why**: Simplifies HTTP interactions and allows customization (e.g., adding retries).

6. **Mock Pattern**
   - **What**: Used for testing, e.g., `email-provisioner-service/infrastructure/email/mock_sender.go` and placeholder mocks in test files (`hr_test.go`, `it_test.go`, `email_test.go`, `access_test.go`).
   - **How It Works**:
     - `MockSender` simulates email sending for testing.
     - Test files use placeholder mocks for repositories and clients to isolate dependencies.
   - **Why**: Enables testing without external systems (e.g., real databases or email providers).

7. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
   - **What**: Defines domain models to reflect business concepts.
   - **How It Works**:
     - Models like `Employee`, `Provision`, `EmailLog`, and `AccessGrant` are defined in `domain` packages.
     - The shared `common/models/employee.go` ensures consistency across services.
   - **Why**: Aligns code with business requirements, making it intuitive and maintainable.

---

## How the Design Patterns Work Together

- **Clean Architecture** structures each service into layers, ensuring that business logic (usecase) is independent of HTTP handling (delivery) and database access (repository). For example, `hr-service/usecase/employee_usecase.go` doesn’t know about MySQL or Gin.
- **Repository Pattern** and **Dependency Injection** enable testing and flexibility. Usecases like `it-setup-service/usecase/provision_usecase.go` depend on interfaces (`ProvisionRepository`), allowing mocks in `it_test.go`.
- **Orchestrator Pattern** in `hr-service` coordinates services via `http/orchestrator.go`, using the **Adapter Pattern** (`httpclient`) for reliable communication.
- **Mock Pattern** supports unit testing by simulating dependencies (e.g., `mock_sender.go` in Email Service).
- **DDD** ensures that data models (e.g., `Employee`, `AccessGrant`) align with business needs, making the system easier to understand.

### **Example Workflow with Patterns**
For an onboarding request:
1. **Clean Architecture**: The request flows through `hr-service` layers: `handler.go` (Delivery) → `usecase.go` (Usecase) → `repository.go` (Repository).
2. **Orchestrator Pattern**: `usecase.go` uses `orchestrator.go` to call other services.
3. **Adapter Pattern**: `httpclient` sends HTTP requests to IT, Email, and Access services.
4. **Repository Pattern**: Each service saves data to its database (e.g., `it_provisions`, `email_logs`, `access_grants`).
5. **DDD**: Models like `Employee` and `Provision` ensure consistent data across services.

## Beginner-Friendly Understanding

Think of the Employee Onboarding System as a restaurant kitchen:
- **HR Service** is the head chef, taking customer orders (onboarding requests) and directing sous-chefs (other services).
- **IT Setup**, **Email Provisioner**, and **Access Rights** services are sous-chefs, each preparing one dish (device, email, permissions).
- **Clean Architecture** organizes the kitchen into stations (prep, cooking, storage) for efficiency.
- **Repository Pattern** is the pantry, hiding how ingredients are stored so chefs only care about getting them.
- **Orchestrator Pattern** is the chef’s order list, ensuring every sous-chef completes their task.
- **Dependency Injection** is like giving chefs the right tools (e.g., a knife) instead of making them find their own.
- **DDD** ensures the menu (data models) matches what customers expect.

The **file flow** is like food moving through the kitchen: the order starts at the HR Service, gets processed through its stations (handler → usecase → repository), sent to other services (sous-chefs), and each service prepares its part, storing results in its pantry (database).

## Possible Improvements to Patterns
- **Saga Pattern**: Use a saga (e.g., via Kafka) for distributed transactions, rolling back if one service fails.
- **Circuit Breaker**: Add a circuit breaker to `httpclient` to handle service failures gracefully.
- **Factory Pattern**: Create a factory for HTTP clients with configurable settings (e.g., timeouts).
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Replace HTTP calls with events (e.g., publish “EmployeeOnboarded” to a queue) for better decoupling.
