You are an expert software architect. Based on the following inputs: - Programming Language: golang - Project Name: qr_code Generate a **comprehensive list of potential features** for this project. Categorize the features into three sections: 1. **Local Features**: Features that run or store data locally on the user's device. 2. **Cloud-Based Features**: Features that leverage cloud services, APIs, or online platforms. 3. **Automation Features**: Features that automate repetitive tasks, improve productivity, or integrate with other tools. For each automation feature, determine whether it would run **locally** or require **cloud services**, and indicate the status clearly as Local or Cloud. For each feature, provide: - Feature Name - Description - Suggested Implementation (based on the given programming language) - Status: Local or Cloud Organize the output neatly in a structured format (tables or lists) so that the **status of each feature is immediately visible**, helping visualize which features are local and which are cloud-based.
