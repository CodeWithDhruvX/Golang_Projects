I want to plan an advanced project that demonstrates **[design_pattern]** and **[DSA_topic]**. 1. **Project Overview:** - Explain the project in simple terms: what it does, its purpose, and its real-world relevance. - Clearly describe how it incorporates **[design_pattern]** and **[DSA_topic]** in practice. 2. **Features and Functionality:** - List the core features the project should include. - Highlight any advanced features or optimizations that showcase best practices in **[design_pattern]** and **[DSA_topic]**. 3. **Architecture and Tech Stack:** - Suggest the **best approach** to implement the project. - Provide a recommended **architecture diagram or flow** (briefly described in text) including layers, modules, and their responsibilities. - Specify suitable **programming language(s)** and any **frameworks/libraries** that make the implementation efficient and maintainable. - Suggest the type of **database** (SQL, NoSQL, in-memory, or a combination) and justify why it fits the project. - Mention any important design or performance considerations. 4. **Implementation Plan:** - Provide a step-by-step flow of the program logic. - Explain how the **[design_pattern]** is applied in different parts of the system. - Explain how **[DSA_topic]** is leveraged to optimize performance or structure. 5. **Optional Enhancements:** - Suggest ways to extend the project in the future. - Include potential integrations with APIs, cloud services, or UI improvements. **Project Name:** qr_code_generator **Programming Language(s):** golang **Design Pattern (automatic if not procided):** [design_pattern] **DSA Topic (automatic if not procided):** [DSA_topic] **Database (if applicable):** [database_type]

Banking System API - project name
CQRS, Saga, Event-Driven, Proxy Pattern - design pattern
Graph (transactions), Union-Find (accounts link), Concurrency (locks, mutex) - dsa


==============================================================================================================
Using the above detailed project plan and architecture, generate the **complete code** for the project.  

Requirements:  
1. Code should be **clean, modular, and well-commented**.  
2. Follow **best practices** for **[design_pattern]** and **[DSA_topic]**.  
3. Include instructions for running the project and example usage.  
4. Ensure proper **error handling, input validation, and readability**.  
5. If a database is used, include **setup and schema creation** steps.  
6. Use the programming language(s) and frameworks/libraries suggested in the project plan.  

**Project Name:** [project_name]  
**Programming Language(s):** golang, graphql, gorm  
**Design Pattern:** CQRS, Saga, Event-Driven, Proxy Pattern  
**DSA Topic:** Graph (transactions), Union-Find (accounts link), Concurrency (locks, mutex) 
**Database (if applicable):** mysql
