Here’s your **English version** of the same instruction set — with the same structure, tone, and detail level, but translated for a global/English-speaking audience 👇

## 🧠 Project Deep Explanation Template (Mentor Style)

### 🔍 What You’ll Do

You’ll provide the **project files** (via README, folder structure, or code snippets).

My task: To generate a **deep, file-by-file explanation** of how the entire project works — in simple, practical language with extra context.

---

### 🗂️ Explanation Structure

#### 1. **Project Overview**

* What’s the **main goal** of the project?
* What’s the **real-world use case** — who would actually use this?
* What **problem** does it solve, and **why is it useful**?

#### 2. **File-by-File Walkthrough**

For each file (in any language):

* **Role in the project** → What’s this file’s responsibility or purpose?
* **Key Highlights** → Important functions, classes, structs, interfaces, or core business logic.
* **Connections** → How this file interacts with others (imports, function calls, API requests, shared data, etc.).
* **Patterns & Principles** → If the file follows any design or architectural principles (e.g., Factory, Singleton, MVC, Clean Architecture), explain it.
* **Beginner-Friendly Analogy** → Simple, intuitive metaphor like:
  “Think of this file as the receptionist — it receives all the requests and routes them to the right department.”

#### 3. **Additional Insights**

* **Real-world usage examples:** What kind of practical scenarios this code would handle.
* **Testing ideas:** How you could test it — via unit tests, CLI commands, API endpoints, mock data, etc.
* **Possible improvements:** Best practices, optimizations, or future enhancements.
* **Performance / scalability notes:** Any aspects related to concurrency, caching, or database optimization.

### 💬 Tone & Style

* Explain like a **friendly mentor** teaching a junior developer.
* Don’t go into boring line-by-line breakdowns.
* Focus on **intuition, flow, and the bigger picture** — make it fun and easy to follow.
* Use **hooks and metaphors** to make concepts stick (like “This file is the brain,” or “This one’s the messenger between systems”).

---

### 🧩 Example Output Style

* **`main.go` / `app.js` / `index.py`** →
  “This is the entry point of the project — think of it as the front door. All user commands, API requests, or initial actions come here first, and then get passed to the right service or handler.”

* **`cache.go` / `cache.py` / `cache.js`** →
  “This acts like a helper that provides fast-access memory (cache). Imagine it as a small notepad where frequently used results are stored — so we don’t have to hit the database again and again.”

* **`db.go` / `database.py` / `models.js`** →
  “This file talks to the database. It handles queries or ORM operations and provides a structured way for the rest of the app to access and manage data.”

---

### 🎯 Final Goal

By the end of the explanation, a **junior developer** should be able to:

* Understand how the **whole project works** without reading every line of code.
* Know the **real-world purpose** of each part.
* See where improvements, optimizations, or extensions can be made.
